# Genetic_Algorithms

Here are the reports and the code used for the Genetic Algorithms class at FII UAIC.
In each folder there should be a pdf file named after its parent directory (H1/h1.pdf). These files represent the final report on the discussed subject.
The third homework (H3) is an exception since there still is work to be done.
